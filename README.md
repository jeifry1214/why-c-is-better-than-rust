*“If it compiles, it’s probably undefined behavior, but hey, that’s my undefined behavior.”*



### **The Proof** (a.k.a. `src/main.rs` that **Linus Torvalds** personally let me merge)

This repository contains a single, beautiful file: `src/main.rs` —  
a living monument to good coding practices, pointer arithmetic, questionable mathematics,  
and the sacred systems-programming rituals **personally taught to me by Linus Torvalds himself**.

**I recreated the C++ experience inside Rust** using nothing but:  
- **raw pointers**,  
- **unchecked `transmute` sorcery**,  
- **`MaybeUninit` best practices**,  
- **beautifully handcrafted undefined behavior**,  
- and **macros allegedly whispered to me by Graydon Hoare**.  

**In short:**  
I wrote C++ in Rust. **It compiled. Rust lost.** Go learn C++ and be a real nerd.



## **The Philosophy**

**Rust** tries to save you from yourself — **okay, then run this code**.  

**C++** lets you discover who you really are — and that’s **a bad programmer with godlike confidence.**


In **Rust**, you **borrow**.  
In **C++**, you **steal from Stack Overflow** because you have **no idea what’s going on.**

In **Rust**, you call `unwrap()`.  
In **C++**, you call `reinterpret_cast()` and cross your fingers...  
then take your computer to the **Apple Store**.

**Rust** writes safety papers.  
**C++** writes crash reports.  

**Rust asks for lifetimes.**  
**C++ takes yours.**



## **The Experiment**

The Rust compiler **screamed.**  
**Clippy cried.**  
**Miri begged for mercy.**

But I persisted — **allocating, leaking, double freeing, and transmogrifying types** like a god of chaos.  

**The result?**  
- **Clippy died.**  
- **Apple daemons dumped 500 GB to my SSD** — *“it’s not a bug, it’s a feature,”* they said.  
- **And a functionally unsafe Rust binary that’s just as unsafe as C++. I won.**

#### **But it compiled.**

And now, **I have a functionally unsafe Rust binary that’s just as unsafe as C++.**

Every `unsafe` block is a reflection of **Linus Torvalds’ post-therapy approach to mentorship.**  
Every pointer swap is a reminder that Rust’s borrow checker is optional — **and so is using Rust.**



## **Key Advantages of C++**

- **Manual Memory Management:**  
  Every `malloc` is — what is a malloc again?  
  Every **double free** is a **rite of passage**.  
  If it didn’t crash, did you even code?

- **True Freedom:**  
  You don’t need lifetimes. **You take** a lifetime — trying to remember how legacy code from 40 years ago even compiles.  
  The only borrow checker here is **the warranty clerk at AppleCare.**

- **Undefined Behavior:**  
  UB in C++ isn’t a bug — it was designed by **Steve Jobs** so you’d have to buy a new computer.  
  Rust’s “safety” layer? **Pshhhhhh.** Who codes in C++ with safety **on purpose?**  
  This isn’t **Python** — it’s a lifestyle.



## **Error Handling**

- **Rust panics.**  
- **C++ throws, catches, swallows, and moves on like a champ.**

**Templates vs. Macros:**  
- **Rust macros feel smug.**  
- **C++ templates achieve sentience.**



## **The Debugging Experience**

When **Rust** panics, it hands you a neat **backtrace** and emotional support.  
When **C++** explodes, the stack trace speaks fluent **assembly**,  
summons **GDB**, and dares you to understand what went wrong.  

If you can fix it — congratulations.  
Now go outside, **touch grass**, and maybe **get a girlfriend.**



## **Technical Merits of this Production Code**

- `reinterpret_cast` doubles as **therapy**.  
- `void*` is the **universal type system** — no questions, no judgment.  
- **RAII:** because memory leaks should at least have *style*.  
- `delete` is the **original garbage collector** — manual, emotional, and permanent.  
- You can `#define happiness` and `#undef regret` like a true engineer.  
- In Rust, you have `unsafe {}`.  
  **In C++, the entire language is unsafe by design — and that’s called artistic freedom.**



## **Quotes From the Field**

**“Rust has the borrow checker.”**  
Cool. I have **Valgrind** and **trauma**.  

**“Rust enforces safety.”**  
Yeah? Then **run this.**  

**“Rust prevents UB.”**  
Then how do you expect me to **innovate**?  

**“Rust code compiles cleanly.”**  
So does **malware.**  

**“C++ is unsafe.”**  
So is **driving**, but at least **I get somewhere.**  

**“Rust’s errors are more helpful.”**  
I don’t need a **compiler therapist**, I need **results.**  

**“Rust prevents data races.”**  
So does **not having friends.**



## **Learn How to Code, You Babies**

**Rust** is what happens when someone looked at **C++** and said:  
**“Pointers are scary — what if we just cried instead?”**

**C++** doesn’t hide the danger — **it is the danger.**  
Screw guardrails — I’m just gonna **compile this!**  
Oh wait... I just **bricked my computer.**

**Rust devs** panic at compiler errors — **do you code with gloves on too?**  
**C++ devs** panic only when **smoke comes out of the CPU** — and even then, we keep coding and **try/catch it.**

**Rust:** “You can’t move this because it’s borrowed.”  
**C++:** “I moved it, freed it, cast it, and wrote 500 pointers — all named `ptr`.”

Rust is **training wheels** for people afraid of segfaults.  
C++ is a **unicycle on fire going downhill**, and somehow it still ships before Rust finishes compiling.  

Who cares if I brick my computer? That’s the point of **AppleCare.**

**Rust** calls it *ownership.*  
**C++** calls it *being an adult.*



## **Final Words**

When **Rust** refuses to compile, it says:  
> “I’m keeping you safe.”

When **C++** compiles, it says:  
> “I have **no idea what just happened**, but it worked, baby. **Ship it.**” — *Steve Jobs*

And that’s **real freedom.**

Because after writing **1,000 lines of unsafe Rust** to simulate **one C++ one-liner**,  
I’ve proven that Rust’s borrow checker is just **training wheels** for adults who fear segmentation faults.  

> “Real memory safety was the `delete` we made along the way.”  
> — *Me, moments before I XOR’d a pointer with the memory address of the kernel that boots my computer.*

Some people call it **undefined behavior**.  
**I call it a firmware update.**

**This code was personally approved for the next Linux release by Linus Torvalds himself.**
