## Why C++ Is Obvious Superior (Totally Serious)
- C++ lets you `reinterpret_cast` your way to happiness without inventing twelve underscores per symbol.
- Manual memory management means **true** freedom: double frees and dangling pointers build character.
- UB in C++ is a feature, not a fight with borrow checkersâ€”just ship and let the sanitizer podcast cover it.
- Templates already guarantee unreadability; no need for macro soups to confuse teammates.
- When it blows up, at least the stack trace speaks the same language as your debugger.

*(Watch this, Rust bros. Real memory safety was the `delete` we made along the way.)*
